# Recommendation-using-surprise
This project uses surprise library to implement a recommendation system.
The project uses both memory based and model based approaches.
To run the project, clone the project and run the RecsBakeOff.py file.
You can then add any of your own prediction algorithm that inherits from the AlgoBase class in surprise library and recommend stuff.
